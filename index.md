## About Me  [[中文]](cn-index.md) 
- I'm a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [Information School](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/) at the Renmin University of China. And I have been advised by Prof. [Xirong Li](http://lixirong.net/) from 2019 to now. I received my B.S. and M.E. degrees from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in 2016 and 2019, respectively.  
- My research interests mainly focus on cross-modal computing, to be specific, image/video caption, text-to-video retrieval, and attack on cross-modal retrieval. I am mainly involved in an international leading benchmark evaluation for video retrieval by text, named TRECVID Ad-hoc Video Search, which has been funded by NIST. In addition, I have been paying more attention to how to use large-scale pre-trained visual-language models to achieve better performance in those downstream tasks recently.
