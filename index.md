## About Me
- I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [Information School](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/) at Renmin University of China. And I am advised by  Prof. [Xirong Li](http://lixirong.net/). My research interests mainly focus on multimedia computing, especially, text to video retireval.
